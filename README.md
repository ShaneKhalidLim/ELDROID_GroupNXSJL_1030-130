Project Description: 
SouvSeek: This app enables tourists and shop owners to engage in seamless transactions. Tourists can browse and purchase items, add them to a wishlist, and search for specific shops. A "Local Shop" feature helps tourists find nearby shops and proceed to payments after selecting item quantities. Shop owners subscribe to the app to access a dashboard for managing their shops, including adding, editing, or deleting listings. Both tourists and shop owners can recover passwords via email verification.
